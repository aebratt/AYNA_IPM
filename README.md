Integrated population model of Atlantic Yellow-nosed Albatross on Gough Island, South Atlantic

Spearheaded by Sarah Converse (USGS), and improved by Cat Horswill (BTO) and Steffen Oppel (RSPB). The data are long-term mark-recapture data collected by numerous volunteers on Gough Island, and the study was originally launched by John Cooper, and then continued by Peter Ryan, Richard Cuthbert, and Alex Bond

The model aims to estimate demographic parameters and population growth rate of this endangered seabird, and examine the effects of fishery bycatch.

DECEMBER 2018: Resumed work on this model because Andrea Angel (ATF) requested an estimate of the potential biological removal that could be permissible for a new trawl fishery in South Africa. After re-organising both count and mark-recapture data, we start with a completely new dataset of a shorter time series (and hopefully fewer errors in the data).
