Integrated population model of Atlantic Yellow-nosed Albatross on Gough Island, South Atlantic

Spearheaded by Sarah Converse (USGS), and improved by Cat Horswill (BTO) and Steffen Oppel (RSPB). The data are long-term mark-recapture data collected by numerous volunteers on Gough Island, and the study was originally launched by John Cooper, and then continued by Peter Ryan, Richard Cuthbert, and Alex Bond

The model aims to estimate demographic parameters and population growth rate of this endangered seabird, and examine the effects of fishery bycatch.
